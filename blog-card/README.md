## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project reinforced my understanding of:

1. Flexbox: For aligning and distributing elements within the blog card.
2. Responsive Design: Ensuring the card adapts well to different screen sizes using media queries.
3. Hover Effects: Making the title interactive with a hover effect.

Here’s an example of the hover effect:

```css
.active:hover {
  color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
  cursor: pointer;
}
```
